Github walkthrough

• Login
• click “New” to create new repo.   Make it public.    Can (should) go back and make it private.
• drag in files to stage them    # staging -- think of this like drafts, preliminary versions
• commit     # the drafts are now verions
• edit a file right on the repo    # now you have a newly revised draft
• commit    # it's a new version
• Click on commits history link      #  see the version history 
• Click on <commitid>          # view the actual diffs
• edit one of the files offline, then drag in and commit    # you've updated and revved the version

• click branch Dropdown and Create a new branch -- see that it's got all the same files   # if you wanted to try something new for example, separate platform, separate developer or bug fixing
• click branch Dropdown and switch to that branch
• commit to this branch
• See all the informational notifications!    Note prompt for “pull request” -- meaning a request for someone to look at file diffs and approve merging branch changes back into main
• click on the commits history link while in each branch      # see the file histories within a branch.   Same file in different branches will have different histories

• click on Pull Request     # system looks to see if there were conflicting changes, eg another branch with a directly conflicting change, then prompts you to merge back into the main branch
• click on merge     # Squash will simplify the commit history.    non-squash keeps all those branch commits visible in commit history.    (nothing will be lost though)

• git clone <url>    # copy repo over to another location or machine.   Can do this if the repo is public
• cd <reponame>      # want to be at the same level as the .git directory
• change a file
• git push                 # can't use password for this.   need a token
